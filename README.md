# Lex-Sort

The files all come together to sort an array indirectly using a linked list

## Files

### Lex.c

Lex requires two options for an input and output file and sorts the input using the linked list from List.c

- <code>input file</code>: specifies the input file to create the unsorted array.
- <code>output file</code>: specifies the output file for the sorted list.

### List.{c,h}

Contains the source and header files for the Linked list ADT implementation

### ListTest.c

Contains the tests to ensure the function of the Linked list ADT from List.c

### Makefile

Makefile contains the commands to compile, clean, and leak test the files
